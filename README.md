# uni-cloud-project

This repo contains all of the code from the cloud computing module that I completed as part of my degree.

The idea was to create an application with a frontend allows the user to enter their grades for each subject that they study. 

The application should also allow the user to sort their grade, identify the largest and lowest grades, their total, and their classification.

I then had to create 2 additional services of my choice. I chose to make a grade averaging service and a grade reviewer that calculates how many additional marks the user would need to reach to next grade boundary.

Each service had to be implemented as a microservice and I had to select at least 4 programming languages to implement these services in. I chose:
- Python
- Dart
- Java
- Kotlin

I also had to create a service proxy, state saver, and monitoring service that can alert an admin if there is an issue with a service.

Each service also had to be containerised, have unit tests, and work with gitlab CI.
